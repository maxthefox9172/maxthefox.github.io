    <h1>Linux troubleshooting</h1>
    <h3>When I try launching Neoalpha it says that I need to download Java, even though I already installed it!</h3>
    <h4>You probably downloaded the .exe version. You need to download the .jar version.</h4>
    <h3>Where are the Neoalpha files located at?</h3>
    <h4>After launching Neoalpha at least once the files should be located at /home/yourlinuxdistusernamehere/.neoalpha. If you don't see the folder, you must show the hidden files (that option is located in the up-right corner menu) (note: this could vary between Linux distributions).</h4>
    <h3>How do I play Neoalpha on Linux?</h3>
    <h4>(Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Pop!_OS 20.04/22.04) In order to play Neoalpha on Linux you'll need to install the Zulu build of OpenJDK. OpenJDK itself won't launch Neoalpha. You can find these builds at <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#download-openjdk">this link</a>. Note that the '.deb' file format can be installed only on Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS) meanwhile '.rpm' file format can be installed only on Fedora Linux-based distributions (e.g. Red Hat Linux, Oracle Linux, CentOS). Note that Neoalpha may not run if you have multiple Java versions installed!</h4>
    <h3>I get stuck at a black screen. How do I fix that?</h3>
    <h4>You probably have multiple Java versions. Uninstall other Java versions (leave just one). From what I've heard (not sure) newer Java versions are unsupported on older Minecraft versions. Java 8 is guaranteed to work. If none of these are the case, you can try updating / installing graphics card drivers. Replacing the LWJGL files also supposedly fixes the issue (instructions on how to do that below). I can't guarantee that these solutions will work though.</h4>
    <h3>How to replace the LWJGL files?</h3>
    <h4>Go to the LWJGL 2 website (<a href ="https://legacy.lwjgl.org/">link here</a>) and click 'Downloads' on the left side. Click the 'LWGJL 2.9.3' link. You will be redirected to SourceForge. Download 'lwjgl-2.9.3.zip'. Open the '.neoalpha' folder (should be located at /home/yourlinuxdistusernamehere/.neoalpha/. If you don't see it, you must click the 'Show Hidden Files' option.). In the '.bin' folder replace 'jinput.jar', 'lwjgl.jar' and 'lwjgl_util.jar' from the zip file (these files are located in the zip file at '/lwjgl2.9.3/jar'). In the 'natives' folder ('/home/yourlinuxdistusernamehere/.neoalpha/bin/natives/') replace all of the files with the files from the zip file (files from the zip are located at '/lwjgl2.9.3/native/linux').</h4>
    <h3>I get a 'Could not init GLX' error. How do I fix it?</h3>
    <h4>You don't have graphics card drivers installed or your drivers are outdated. You need to install / update them. I'm not going to write a guide on how to do that, as the installation depends on the graphics card and the Linux distribution. Just search up 'how to install (your graphics card developer/name) drivers on (your Linux distribution name)' in a search engine.</h4>

    <h1>General troubleshooting</h1>
    <h3>To run the game you need Java with the version being at least 7.</h3>
    <h3>I can't connect to the Neoalpha server in-game.</h3>
    <h4>Either something is wrong with your internet connection or the server is offline. To check if the server is offline just go to the Neoalpha website. The server status is at the bottom of the Home page.</h4>
    <h3>Why do I keep getting disconnected from the server and get an error (e.g. IOException)?</h3>
    <h4>Your internet connection could be slow. Try e.g. resetting your internet router.</h4>
    <h3>When logging in I can't connect to play in Online Mode.</h3>
    <h4>That happens when you created an account very recently. You should wait a while to play online.</h4>
